# if...else in one line
# ? There is also a shorthand syntax for the if-else statement that can be used when the condition being tested is simple and the code blocks to be executed are short.
# Example
a = 2
b = 320
print("A") if a > b else print("B")

# We can have multiple if-else statements on the same line
a = 330
b = 330
print('A') if a > b else print('=') if a == b else print('B')
# Another Example
# result = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
